# PUMA
PUMA is a project management system - more (actual, working) features coming soon.

## Running Puma
Running PUMA is easy:  
a. Install git (from the [official website](https://git-scm.com/)).  
b. Install Meteor (which you can download from [here](https://www.meteor.com)).  
c. clone the project:

    git clone https://github.com/PUMATeam/puma.git

d. change into the project's main directory and run the command:

	meteor

And you will have PUMA running on localhost:3000 (by default)!
